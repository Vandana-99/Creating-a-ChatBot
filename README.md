# Creating-a-ChatBot

A text-based conversational agent(Chatbot) has been designed  in this project for answering questions based on real word data from wikipedia using the Python Programming Language 
by employing Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) library. It is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

# Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to converse with the chatbot where, bot answers the user questions which are taken from the training data(csv file)

# Instructions for testing the software

Step-1: Set up a test environment 

The first step in testing the project is setting up a platform. For instance(Jupyter Notebook) which is a development environment for writing and testing the softwares

Step-2: Downloading the training data(csv file)

After setting up the environment, a training data file has to been downloaded where question and answers are included in that file.

Step-3: Running the chatbot software 

Next step is running the chatbot. After running the software, a Graphical User Interface will appear where the actual conversation between the user and the chatbot happens.

Step-4: Testing the chatbot software

In the Gui, we can test the bot by posing some questions from the training data where,
the bot responds to the questions accurately which were posted by the user.
